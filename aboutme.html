	<h2> The History of Asians is quite fascinating. It all began in 243,000 B.C, when mankind was just coming out of their caves. Many Historians and Archaelogiolists believe that we are descendants of monkeys, and while that is true for some, asians were of rat descent. The earliest known asian was named Skrolk, and was believed to live around 238,200 B.C. </h2>

	<h3> Today, however, asians are much less rat-like and have adapted to their surroundings. Historians have looked into several modern asians today see the evolution of the rat people. One such asian historians have observed is a boy named Thomas Ku.</h3>
